## Project Proposals 

### Idea 1
Resident Advising 

### Main idea
- A app made for college Ra's to assist with college life. Users can stay up to date with students. 
### User story
- Users can manage students
- Users can plan student activities
- Users can check students pass activities 
- Users can check students classes

### How I will use the concepts I recently learned to meet the project requirements 

- Object Oriented Python 
    - Class for Students with attributes
    - Class for User with attributes  
-Database Tables 
    -Table: Users 
    - id
    - username
    -Table: Students
    - id
    - name 
    - email
    -Table: (many to many) User-Students  == "Ra to student"
    - id 
    - student id
- Object Relationships
     - Users can have many students
     - students can be assigned many users
- Aggregate and Association Methods 
    - CRUD
    - Create
        - Create a list of students
    -Read
        - Display all students
    - Update
        - Add students
    - Delete
- Use of Data Structures 
    - List: Users could have a list of students 
    - Dictionary: Students has a set of attributes and values

### what area I think will be most challenging

- Making sure I don't have any dry code in my project. And meeting requirements
